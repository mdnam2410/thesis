\label{subsec:dataset}
In our study, we use the Chest X-Ray Images with Pneumothorax Masks dataset. This dataset contains the stage 1 train and test data extracted from the Kaggle SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation competition \cite{pneumothorax}. This dataset encompasses a collection of medical images specifically curated for investigating and addressing the challenges associated with pneumothorax, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the presence of air in the pleural cavity, leading to lung collapse. This dataset comprises a total of 12,047 chest X-ray images, encompassing 10,675 samples designated for training and an additional 1,372 samples for testing. To ensure the reliability and generalizability of our models, we further partition the training samples into training and validation subsets using a ratio of 9:1, respectively. This division facilitates the assessment of model performance on unseen data and enables the selection of optimal hyperparameters.
