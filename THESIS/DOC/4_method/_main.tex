\label{ch:proposedMethod}
In this chapter, we outline our approach for measuring the level of disagreement between various saliency-based methods. Firstly, we explain the mathematical formula behind four metrics that we used, which include feature agreement, sign agreement, rank correlation (inherited and adapted for images from \cite{krishna_disagreement_problem}), and structural similarity index metric. Next, we select several saliency-based methods for generating explanations, including both gradient-based and perturbation-based. We also discuss the selection of two black box convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - InceptionV3 and ResNet - and provide an overview of their architecture.
