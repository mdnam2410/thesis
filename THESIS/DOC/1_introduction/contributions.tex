In this research, we conducted experiments using saliency map-based explanation methods on a chest Xray dataset. The conclusions drawn from this study can potentially contribute to XAI in general, and specifically in the medical field. The following are the potential contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluating the accuracy of explanation methods in terms of localization utility.
    \item Identifying the disagreement trend among saliency map explanations.
    \item Identifying the reasons behind the discrepancies between different explanation methods, laying the foundation for further research to address this issue.
\end{itemize}
