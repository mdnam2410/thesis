\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
This chapter provides the context for our thesis and outlines the problem we aim to address. Firstly, we highlight the necessity for XAI in making complex models more interpretable to users and introduce saliency maps as a potential solution. We then present the disagreement problem, which arises when different XAI methods provide conflicting explanations for a complex black box. Ultimately, we state the goal of our thesis to explore the extent of disagreement among saliency methods, an area that has yet to receive extensive research attention.
