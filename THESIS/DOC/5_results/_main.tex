\chapter{Experiments \& Result}
\label{ch:experimentsAndResult}
In this chapter, we provide a detailed description of our experiment in measuring disagreement, as well as a discussion about our findings. First, we describe the dataset, the environment configurations we used, the two CNNs that we used as black boxes for our experiment, and how we measured disagreement. Then, we analyze the results and conclude that there are indeed disagreements among the explanation methods.
