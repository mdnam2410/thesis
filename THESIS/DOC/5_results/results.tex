\section{Results}
\label{sec:result}

In this section we discuss the results of our experiment for each of the disagreement metric. First, we analyze the disagreement scores of the explanation methods on both dataset separately. Then, we compare the levels of disagreement from both datasets and discuss some insights by looking at the overall view of the disagreement. Finally, we provide some remarks on the potential reason for the pattern of disagreement between the methods.
