\label{ch:background}
In this chapter, we set the foundation for our thesis by providing general knowledge about XAI, its history, and classify the field's approaches. In addition, we also introduce some popular saliency-based methods, divided into gradient-based and perturbation-based approaches, and presents general overview about their workings.
