In this chapter, we introduce the notion of the disagreement problem in XAI. Next, we explore some related research on this problem and show how there is a lack of extensive studies on the disagreement between general XAI methods, not to mention methods that utilize saliency maps. Then, we explore progress in the field regarding the assessment of the quality of saliency maps.

% - disagreement problem of XAI
% - the scarcity of research about the disagreement problem
% - research that focus on assessing the performance of saliency masks
